# This is a system-wide configuration file used to
# keep track of registries for various container backends.
# It adheres to YAML format and does not support recursive
# lists of registries.

# The default location for this configuration file is /etc/containers/registries.conf.

# The only valid categories are: 'registries', 'insecure_registies', 
# and 'block_registries'.


registries:
  - brew-pulp-docker01.web.prod.ext.phx2.redhat.com:8888
  - registry.ops.openshift.com
  - registry.fedoraproject.org
  - registry.access.redhat.com


# If you need to access insecure registries, uncomment the section below
# and add the registries fully-qualified name. An insecure registry is one
# that does not have a valid SSL certificate or only does HTTP.
insecure_registries:
  - brew-pulp-docker01.web.prod.ext.phx2.redhat.com:8888
  - registry.ops.openshift.com

# If you need to block pull access from a registry, uncomment the section below
# and add the registries fully-qualified name.
